PATIENTS WITH A CONDITION
1527


METHOD 1: LIKE OPERATOR

SELECT *
FROM Patients
WHERE
  conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%'
  OR conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%';

Explanation:
•	This query checks whether the conditions column starts with the prefix "DIAB1" or if "DIAB1" appears anywhere in the conditions after a space. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

•	LIKE 'DIAB1%':This condition checks if the conditions string starts with the prefix "DIAB1".The % symbol is a wildcard that matches any number of characters after "DIAB1".


•	LIKE '% DIAB1%':This condition checks if " DIAB1" appears anywhere in the conditions string after a space.The % before " DIAB1" allows any characters before the " DIAB1", ensuring it matches only when "DIAB1" starts after a space.

•	This query efficiently captures all cases where "DIAB1" appears at the beginning of the string or after a space, ensuring we find patients with the condition for Type I Diabetes as expected.

METHOD 2: REGEXP FOR REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING

SELECT patient_id, patient_name, conditions
FROM Patients
WHERE conditions REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1';

Explanation:
•	This query uses regular expression (REGEXP) to match patients who have the condition for Type I Diabetes, which starts with "DIAB1" either at the beginning of the conditions string or after a space.
•	REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1':
•	^: This matches the beginning of the string. So, "DIAB1" appearing as the first condition will be matched.
•	|: This acts as an OR operator. It checks if "DIAB1" either starts at the beginning of the string or after a space.
•	 A space, ensuring that "DIAB1" appears as a distinct word after a space in the string.
•	"DIAB1": The exact prefix we're looking for in the conditions column.
•	 (^| ) ensures that "DIAB1" is either the first condition or appears as a distinct word in the middle of the conditions string.
•	REGEXP is more powerful and flexible than LIKE for pattern matching, allowing for more precise control over string searches.

METHOD 3 : LOCATE()

SELECT patient_id, patient_name, conditions
FROM Patients
WHERE LOCATE('DIAB1', conditions) > 0;

Explanation:
•	 This query uses the LOCATE() function to find patients who have a condition starting with the "DIAB1" prefix in their conditions column.

•	LOCATE('DIAB1', conditions):The LOCATE() function returns the starting position of the substring "DIAB1" in the conditions column.
•	If "DIAB1" is found, it will return a positive integer indicating the position where it starts.
•	If "DIAB1" is not found, the function returns 0.
•	LOCATE('DIAB1', conditions) > 0:This ensures that "DIAB1" exists somewhere in the conditions column.
•	If the return value is greater than 0, it means "DIAB1" is present in the conditions for that patient.
